6,1,Netherlands,The new normal,"We have become accustomed to seeing many of those phrases in our cities of today. They hide injustices behind them, and if honestly spoken, they would be far more scarring."

12,1,Netherlands,The new normal,"Today, we should be questioning what we see as “normal”; our society should learn to look into those phrases with the eye of the unallowed, the unwanted, the unwelcome, the minority and the ineligible!"
13,1,Netherlands,The new normal,"The challenges faced by our cities in 2020 are no longer bound to matters of environment, resources, technology, and sustainability. The COVID-19 Pandemic has exposed the virus of injustice that has been rotting in our cities. When the whole world shared the same enemy, access to safety was a privilege."
14,1,Netherlands,The new normal,“Privilege is when you think that something is not a problem because it’s not a problem for you personally.” – David Guider.
15,1,Netherlands,The new normal,"When privilege surfaced during the pandemic, injustices in the cities were brought to light. Injustice is found in architecture and housing, it is found in urban planning, Urban spaces, urban infrastructure, and city services."
16,1,Netherlands,The new normal,"Injustice is embodied in architecture when housing exceeded its definition as a mere shelter. Access to accommodative architecture, well-lit spaces, proper ventilation, and privacy have become a privilege, not a right in the pandemic. What about those who live in the slums? Those who were denied the right to housing simply because they were refugees, they did not belong, or they were not welcome? This is where we call for the just city, where housing policies need to be more inclusive, and proper architecture needs to be more attainable. Maybe it is time to let go of expensive architectural solutions and return to our ancestors who, through little effort, incorporated light, sunshine, warmth, and ventilation in their vernacular homes."
17,1,Netherlands,The new normal,"Injustice is embodied in urban planning when segregation is accentuated with plans that serve the benefit of one part of society. Segregation happens when urban plans do not account for all societal groups, when urban plans put economic sustainability in front of social sustainability, when the price of the square meter is far more important than the price of social cohesion. Far more explicitly, segregation brings out the social divide where people can feel strangers in their own cities. This is a call to revisit our urban planning policies that should encompass all layers of society and all streams of community. This is a wake-up call to remember that social integration results in resilient societies, who through a global pandemic, can support each other as a community and as a whole body."
18,1,Netherlands,The new normal,"Injustice is embodied in the public urban spaces that are decreasing in size, that are replaced by investment projects, and that are restricting what we would like to call urban freedom. Public spaces are slowly being privatized in the name of public private partnerships for the sake of developing urban projects. This is creating a limit on the urban freedom, where going to a public area comes with a manual of Do’s and Don’ts. This calls us to look back onto our cities, to give more freedom to the public, to make room for spontaneity in urban planning, and to let our cities be shaped by those who inhabit them."
19,1,Netherlands,The new normal,"Injustice in embodied in the infrastructure, specifically the health dimension of our cities. During the pandemic, safety was a privilege and that is the most basic human needs. Inequalities were not only available on a city scale, but furthermore on a world scale. Like cities, different countries had access to different tools, and many people had to die because of lack of access, because of injustice. We need to rethink the priorities in our city’s infrastructure, are bridges more important than public hospitals?"
20,1,Netherlands,The new normal,"Injustice can be found in all the layers, but to achieve the Just City, we, as society, should let go of the slogans we have become so impartial to, and create a new normal where we put forward our values of"

29,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,Introduction: Educating towards the just city
30,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"We imagine a city in which religion, origin, skin color, gender, are not confronted, but enriched. We dream of a colorful and living city, home to diverse people and access-ible to all its citizens, where all have an equal right to the city."
31,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"In this manifesto, we emphasize the educational system, as it is the main structural pillar of our society and the precondition to prepare all in creating, living, and fostering a just city. Inspiring generations by giving the example, professionally and humanely. This is the most efficient way to synchronize intellectually, spiritually, and ideolog-ically."
32,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,But how could governments implement such a shift? How do we ensure that all citizens are represented by the cities they live in? How do we make politics more accessible for future generations?
33,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,Governments
34,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,A just city is supported by a government that fosters critical learning for both its citizens and themselves.
35,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"The government should create laws with popular assemblies, exchanging knowledge that will ensure representative cities."
36,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"If technology can create an important step towards the Universal Human right to housing, it should not be treated as a financial product. Technologies able to create a breakthrough in any structural aspect of this pyramid should be shared horizontally with the common goal of creating a just city."
37,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,Civic participation within the political realm has to be promoted by governments.
38,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"Engage in accumulating educational projects and at the same time building the citizenry. This participative way of educating should be applied on an international level, giving the right to citizens to create their history, with a local identity and experience."
39,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,Citizens
40,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"Citizens have to be concerned by the realities they live in and by their actions, forcing governments to create a dialogue. Both should have the same determination to work with each other."
41,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"“Man is, by nature, a political animal” (Hatemi & McDermott, 2011). We complain, criticize, and if for a reason or another, we would stop complaining, would we still be human?"
42,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"Transforming the feeling of hopelessness into action. We are used to seeing social movements from a mainstream western perspective, highlighting names such as Ernesto “El Ché” Guevarra or Nelson Mandela. We end up feeling powerless when thinking about how a single person could make that difference? A hopeless feeling that often prevents us from taking action."
43,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"We should not forget that history is made by the millions of individuals believing in the same cause. This cause obligates us to debate, question our beliefs, compromise, and learn, and in this cycle, taking responsibility for our common future. The decision-makers of tomorrow will then not only be politicians or urban planners, every citizen will be."
44,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"But how do we prepare citizens of tomorrow for those challenging questions? We think that education comes in various forms, such as popular participation that lead to participatory democracies, requiring multidisciplinary projects."
45,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"Therefore, the power of knowledge has to be shared horizontally between decision-makers and citizens, trusting and guiding them as a teacher that doesn’t teach but listens. We will then “design for the people‘s basic needs” (Papanek, 2005)."
46,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,Universities
47,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"Universities must strengthen their relationships with governments, in such to consolidate the communication between Government, University, and Students."
48,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"Why do most of the students, leaving architectural schools, struggle to design for the “real world “? What should we learn to be empathic and intuitive architects?"
49,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"Remove automation from architectural education (defamiliarization). For the process of education to not become automatic and habitual, it constantly needs to defamiliarize itself - looking at common things from new, unknown perspectives."
50,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"Collaboration and interdisciplinarity. Complex, hard-to-define issues must be addressed through collaboration between different disciplines."
51,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"Officially stating our support/position against the status quo, addressing and combating the hegemonic power structures - tutors being an example for students and vice versa. Engage with the public outside of the school, creating a common agency with its students. This manifesto is the proof of a well-coordinated and shared vision between institution and individual."
52,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"Universities have to be transparent about the present processes in society, giving insight into factual issues and potential solutions. Giving students empirical information on the newest possibilities for a more sustainable, participative, and inclusionary future. Create openness for young relevant input through debate or eventual surveys."
53,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,Schools
54,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"Education must be shared, for that reason, we should not wait for people to get into higher education to teach empathy and critical thinking. The well-communication between Government and Universities must be constructed as a philosophy for the youngest generations."
55,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"How should education in schools lead towards a just city? When we are children, the language or ethnicity of others doesn’t matter much to understand each other. We need to strengthen and promote these qualities because these children/pupils are going to be the citizens of tomorrow and contribute to a just city."
56,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"Defining problems, rather than solving them. How issues are addressed is even more important than the solutions themselves. This principle needs to be taught in educational institutions, starting from kindergarteners, schools, and universities. Therefore, empathy, curiosity, and intuition are important tools to generate consequent designs."
57,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"Introducing new school subjects. How should schools of tomorrow be designed so that children learn that all people have the right to the city? A school subject where children could playfully engage with their living environment and learn that everyone can contribute to it as individuals, as a group, claiming the right to the city by being in the city. Educating kids from a young age to be critical about spirituality, freedom, and religions. Give them enough space to be themselves amongst debates and decision making."
58,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,Conclusions
59,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"New laws and policies must be created to protect and ensure the right to participate in projects. By sharing knowledge, at every socio-economic level, we will create projects that relate to the daily life of citizens, letting everyone create an identity with their city. This concept often clashes with the present education system, as it perpetuates the financial and political structure of nowadays, which only replicates the error of past centuries in housing policies."
60,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"Every level of society should keep a perpetual motion of mutual education. Only in that way, cities would finally represent all citizens, respecting their social context, and improving their quality of life."
61,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"Educating in schools and universities, it is important to spend enough time defining the non-obvious issues of “pre-defined” problems through collaboration and interdisciplinarity. Teaching open-mindedness for unexpected results, responsively and responsibly."
62,2,Belgium,Educating towards a just city,"If education and learning could be applied like this, the strictly hierarchical pyramid then becomes a converging spiral where all work together towards a just city."

75,3,USA,Covid – 19 RESET- for the Just City,"Racism, religion and socio-economic status have long been used to maintain dominance and classify people as somehow less-than-human - as outsiders. Fear and mistreatment of the vulnerable has gone unchecked for too long."

88,3,USA,Covid – 19 RESET- for the Just City,"Not only is it necessary to get individuals from their housing to jobs, amenities, and healthy spaces; public transportation comes with its own inherent benefits."

94,3,USA,Covid – 19 RESET- for the Just City,"Not only in the higher infection and mortality rates that have disproportionately affected minorities and those with lower income, but also the economic impact as most of the jobs lost fall into the category of lower wage and informal/gig workers."
95,3,USA,Covid – 19 RESET- for the Just City, We have seen that governments have the capacity to care for their people in these trying times through wage replacement or enhanced unemployment programs as well as eviction and utility turn off protections for the most vulnerable. 
96,3,USA,Covid – 19 RESET- for the Just City,This needs to be the norm because opportunities for fair wages and housing are a basic human right.

"
109,3,USA,Covid – 19 RESET- for the Just City,"With the understanding that all people make essential contributions in our societies (regardless of their status), it is time to lay claim to our collective power and issue a call to RESTART the spatial injustice conversation; demanding that measurable actions and steps be taken to build back better and eliminate spatial inequities that endanger and diminish the lives of so many people.

135,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,What a JUST-CITY means TODAY for us?
136,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,"We strongly believe that the JUST-CITY is a city housing and the right to the city is recognised as universal rights. Our work as spatial planners has a strong impact on people. We believe that to design the JUST-CITY we need to translate ethical and social awareness into technical practices. When we design cities, indeed, we design citizenship. The today JUST-CITY should be organic and harmonious. We strongly believe that the city should be flexible and interactive in all its aspects, both urban and ecological."
137,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,"Nowadays, cities face multiple challenges: COVID-19 pandemic together with climate change and socio-economic conditions have stressed the already existing spatial and social constant injustices."
138,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,"The global pandemic has underlined the spatial weaknesses and inequalities in the contemporary city. In the past, rationalist and industrial cities have been planned according to their functions and zoning techniques, which produced man-oriented and discriminatory spaces of the city. We consider that city planning should incorporate the principles of universal design and accessibility to overcome the barriers of discrimination and segregation. The alienation generated in the past has shown us that today we must plan cities for the people without any distinction."
139,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,What technical approach to planning the JUST-CITY?
140,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,"We support more versatile tools, rather than a legally binding planning system towards flexibility."
141,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,"New planning tools must be able to adapt to the constantly evolving needs of citizens, deeply affecting the dynamic flows of the city itself capturing urban dynamism."
142,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,How can these ideas be translated into a spatial form?
143,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,"COMPACT CITY. The different areas of the JUST-CITY must be equally enhanced and better interconnected. JUST-CITY is not determined simply by their centres; on the contrary, peripheries are cities’ backbone and their fuel."
144,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,ORGANIC CITY. The JUST-CITY must be perceived as a whole rather than a collection of fragmented areas. The infrastructure network should be expanded and facilitated to ensure the harmonisation of the city transport system. Sustainable and affordable mobility is essential in guaranteeing equal access to opportunities in the city.
145,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,"POLYCENTRIC CITY. Different districts of one city, more cities within a wider area can offer unique resources, knowledge and good practices. We must develop a valuable infrastructures network to foster interdependence and cooperation."
146,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,Which are the main principles implemented in the JUST-CITY?
147,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,RIGHT TO HOUSING
148,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,"Housing must be guaranteed as a public responsibility, preserving the identity of the city, which is given by its inhabitants and its everyday dynamics."
149,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,"If city recognises housing as a universal human right, they should provide policies that increase and incorporate affordable housing within urban settlements. We believe that, in guaranteeing the right to housing, it is inseparable to certify an aesthetic value that is sustained for different types of housing."
150,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,"Free accessible toilets. The JUST-CITY must provide all sort of public services, in particular those affecting not only the hygiene and health of citizens but truly affecting their dignity."
151,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,SUSTAINABILITY
152,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,"Planners must ensure the attractiveness of the JUST-CITY, by providing the spatial contexts able to support more sustainable attitudes. For example, by creating a more integrated system of infrastructure that encompasses different types of sustainable mobility (bike/skate/scooters/electric car-pooling and sharing)."
153,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,"The JUST-CITY must embrace the diversity of its new residents, which is the added value to the city evolving identity, engage them in discussions about their social and economic wellbeing and strengthen the sense of community."
154,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,MONITORING
155,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,"Use of environmental, social and economic indicators, aimed at evaluating people wellbeing and effective benefits of policies implementation."
156,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,LOCAL ECONOMY
157,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,"Promoting neighbourhood businesses, not the use of frantic online shopping (eg. amazon), yields not only spatial benefits but also social and economic ones, by enhancing the sense of community while fostering the citizens’ livelihood."
158,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,PUBLIC GREEN AREAS
159,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,"The design of the 15 minutes city must guarantee the accessibility to the green areas of the city. Residents must be empowered to gain access to the management of the green areas in their respective neighbourhoods, to foster a greater sense of belonging."
160,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,Who is involved in this process?
161,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,WE DREAM. WE LISTEN. WE SUPPORT. WE PLAN.
162,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,"In order to achieve the just city that we envision, it is fundamental to establish meaningful ways of engagement and interaction among all actors."
163,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,Could a woman walk alone at night in 2021? Let us start with safety.
164,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,UNPRECEDENT TIMES CALL FOR UNPRECEDENTED SOLUTIONS! ACTIONS.
165,4,Italy,Towards the Sensitive City,"Now is the time to claim the change we want to see in our cities. In our space. In our societies. Now is the time to ACT. We call on all planners, architects, public officials and all persons who believe that the city belongs to them, wherever you are, and no matter how small or big the role you play, we call on you to step up and ACT. Reach out. Inform. Educate. Participate. Engage. Cooperate. Design. Create the JUST CITY you want to live in. We call on this generation of young planners, architects, on the youth of all disciplines, to carry the values and principles of spatial and social justice and with innovation, and with kindness, build the JUST and EQUITABLE future you demand.

213,6,Netherlands,Build back better,Build back better
214,6,Netherlands,Build back better,The 2020 pandemic is a tipping point that has strained justice in European cities on many levels.
215,6,Netherlands,Build back better,The current crisis reinforces prevailing disparities in our cities and has turned tables on what each of us perceives as ‘Just’.
216,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"However, this is not the time to wonder “could it get worse?” – it is our chance to build back better, start transforming our society and let go of outdated approaches to urban governance."
217,6,Netherlands,Build back better,The question is – what can you do to prepare for the challenges ahead?
218,6,Netherlands,Build back better,The future justice in and of our cities depends on the quality of decisions and actions that we take right now!
219,6,Netherlands,Build back better,Hold your representatives accountable and call with us for the following five points of action.
220,6,Netherlands,Build back better,I. A Just City should... Be affordable to live in for all!
221,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"We believe living in a city, a hub of amenities and opportunities for employment and self-development, should be accessible for all."
222,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"Therefore, it is important to provide affordable housing for everyone wishing to move or stay in the city, regardless of your socio-economic background."
223,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"To ensure equal access to urban amenities and boost social mobility, we believe there should be fair housing options available in the city."
224,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"The housing market dynamics in cities have shown a rapid increase of property and land value over the last years, which makes living in the city unattainable for many."
225,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"It is our representatives’ responsibility to regulate factors, such as gentrification and the effects"
226,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"of foreign investment, which impact cities’ affordability."
227,6,Netherlands,Build back better,The current COVID-19 crisis is the opportunity for us to change the way we look at housing and protect people’s rights to live in the city!
228,6,Netherlands,Build back better,II. A Just City should... Actively support local entrepreneurship!
229,6,Netherlands,Build back better,We believe that supporting local shops and businesses is key to a culturally sustainable urban development and regeneration.
230,6,Netherlands,Build back better,The COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns have demonstrated the vulnerabilities of small
231,6,Netherlands,Build back better,local businesses.
232,6,Netherlands,Build back better,We believe that a Just City should provide the rights to the production and consumption of local
233,6,Netherlands,Build back better,urban culture to its residents.
234,6,Netherlands,Build back better,Local entrepreneurship is paramount to inclusive economic innovation and the development of local skills and knowledge.
235,6,Netherlands,Build back better,It needs to be fostered through local policies that ensure fair competition in a globalized and digitized world.
236,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"To strengthen the resilience of local economies, we need to not only invest in places but also in the capacity-building of residents by fostering vital connections between local entrepreneurs"
237,6,Netherlands,Build back better,and industries.
238,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"This way, local products and ideas can enrich the cultural diversity of today’s globalized cities. Let’s do justice to local communities by giving them back the agency to shape their surroundings!"
239,6,Netherlands,Build back better,III. A Just City should... Have equity at the heart of its discussions!
240,6,Netherlands,Build back better,Equality was a favourite word of our representatives for a long time.
241,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"However, is equality what we need?"
242,6,Netherlands,Build back better,We are different and this requires us to be treated distinctly.
243,6,Netherlands,Build back better,Not putting sticks in each other's wheels but lifting up the people who from the start find themselves a couple steps behind.
244,6,Netherlands,Build back better,In a Just City people should be treated equitably.
245,6,Netherlands,Build back better,Many measures are not designed with equity in mind.
246,6,Netherlands,Build back better,These measures need to be adjusted to the needs of the people.
247,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"It is as essential to put up ramps to help physically disabled people to get places, as it is to invest more in education in places where parents do not have the means to help their children succeed."
248,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"The COVID-19 crisis has shown us that some people need more support than others. Governments must, through a step-by-step approach, rethink our priorities."
249,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"Together, we will be able to create equitable spaces and maybe someday we will be able to"
250,6,Netherlands,Build back better,be proud of and celebrate our differences!
251,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"IV. A Just City should... Be inclusive, diverse & solidary!"
252,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"Our diversifying cities should act against uneven urban growth, regeneration and access to opportunities."
253,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the condition of those with deficient opportunities. Cities, especially in these times, should be at the forefront of progressive solidarity and battle discrimination, racism and sexism."
254,6,Netherlands,Build back better,We can only move forward by taking equitable actions in favour of those in high need for support or suffering from historical intolerances.
255,6,Netherlands,Build back better,All urban actors should foster their solidarity towards those who are misrepresented.
256,6,Netherlands,Build back better,We stand up for plans and policies which seriously reflect the diversity of a city’s inhabitants and adapt their initiatives to this diversity accordingly.
257,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"Legal requirements should, for example, be introduced for inclusive and responsive participation processes involving the entire spectrum of socio-economic groups!"
258,6,Netherlands,Build back better,V. A Just City should... Have public space that feels public-friendly!
259,6,Netherlands,Build back better,The reality of today's public spaces in cities is simple: scarcely any physical spaces perceived as ‘public’ are people-based.
260,6,Netherlands,Build back better,Ambiguity over interpretations of user spaces gives way to confusion over the extent to which the citizens can claim to appropriate them.
261,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"Cities should give a more active role to the members of their communities in the management and preservation of public spaces, particularly those that are designed for social interaction and"
262,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"movement, such as urban parks and railway stations."
263,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"Currently, our shared spaces are at a risk of becoming overly homogenized to fit the mould of modern urban planning."
264,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"In a Just City, public-spaces should allow us to express the mix of cultural identities within our society."
265,6,Netherlands,Build back better,"By providing the platform for different communities to interact and work together, we can contribute to a shared sense of identity that we believe to be a valuable asset in the creation of a Just and united City!"
266,6,Netherlands,Build back better,Each of us can play a role in making cities just.
267,6,Netherlands,Build back better,Let’s join our forces and let’s come together at the intersection of these different dimensions of Urban Justice!

270,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,1.Young people:
271,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,Planning is about the FUTURE.
272,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,"Unfortunately engagement around planning issues has historically been dominated by the same voices: people who are time rich, and who generally have greater social capital."
273,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,Young people care about the city around them but fail to get involved as there are limited opportunities for their perspectives to be acknowledged.
274,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,Greater IMAGINATION is needed to get people ENGAGED in planning and to empower them with the AUTHORITY to influence planning outcomes.
275,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,2. Diversity:
276,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,The reliance on evidence based policies in planning means that the knowledge of experts often trumps the lived experiences of local people.
277,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,"In addition to ensuring young people are engaged, planning needs to ensure LOCAL KNOWLEDGE is recognised and used to shape cities."
278,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,The city is not homogenous.
279,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,"In order for the city to work for all people, decision making processes must give minority populations a VOICE."
280,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,3. Equity:
281,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,Planning is about making a place for EVERYONE.
282,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,The contemporary city is characterised by unaffordable housing and disparity in terms of opportunities and wealth.
283,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,The future of planning must dismantle these systems and create more affordable housing and opportunities for marginalised communities.
284,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,"As private companies are increasingly relied upon to build our cities, measures are needed to ensure that the interests of stakeholders are not placed above the needs of the public."
285,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,4. Safety:
286,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,The city must be safe for all races and genders of people.
287,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,The Black Lives Matter movement since its inception in 2013 has highlighted the ongoing history of violence towards black people by police illustrating that the city is not safe for everyone.
288,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,"Additionally, lack of consideration of women and non-heterosexual people has resulted in a lack of safety and inclusion in some city spaces."
289,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,"While these concerns cannot fully be addressed by planners, planners must work COLLABORATIVELY with stakeholders to ensure all members of the city feel safe throughout their lives."
290,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,5. Health:
291,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,The city must facilitate healthy lifestyles.
292,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,The ongoing global pandemic has highlighted the twin crises of health and inequality.
293,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,The lowest socioeconomic groups have been hit hardest by the pandemic because of the high prevalence of pre-existing conditions in low income communities.
294,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,These conditions include obesity related diseases such as diabetes caused by lack of access to healthy foods and respiratory diseases such asthma caused by poor air quality or poor quality housing.
295,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,"Planners have a RESPONSIBILITY to ensure spaces are provided PROACTIVELY to address these issues such as providing more high-quality affordable housing, more spaces for exercise, and better access to healthy food."
296,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,6. Flexible Places:
297,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,"Space has always been invested with a sense of identity through perceptions of ownership; it is constantly fought over, mapped, and bounded."
298,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,These histories impact the intrinsically local nature of individuals’ sense of ‘place’ (Massey 2005).
299,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,"In a globalised world, there is a tension between the local practice of planning, rooted in cultural traditions and institutional structures, and the implementation of these internationally focussed, overarching principles for building a Just City."
300,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,"FLEXIBILITY is crucial, on both sides, for ensuring the practical application of these principles to a variety of contexts."
301,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,7.  Biodiversity:
302,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,The global climate crisis coupled with the fact that the majority of the world’s population now live in urban settlements has increased the importance of CONSERVING and ENHANCING biodiversity in cities.
303,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,Urban green spaces are crucial habitats to support and restore biodiversity and promote community engagement through local gardening and food-growing initiatives.
304,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,"By increasing biodiversity in cities, air pollution rates can also improve, thereby resulting in a greener and more interesting urban area and promoting healthier lifestyles to the benefit of all inhabitants."
305,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,8. Infrastructure:
306,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,Investing in infrastructure has become an increasingly popular means to combat inequality in cities around the world.
307,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,"However, evidence suggests that an uneven material interpretation of infrastructure has actually fostered spatial inequality (Pieterse et al., 2018)."
308,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,"If asset management and infrastructure are to help create a just city, thinking must depart from seeing infrastructure as the ultimate solution to economic development and from the simplified understanding of infrastructure as large physical structures of basic services."
309,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,Investment in SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE is just as sure to reduce inequalities across the globe.
310,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,The COVID 19 pandemic has shown that a just city should use infrastructure to combat isolation and education inequalities as much as it should provide roads and highways.
311,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,9. Language:
312,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,Spatial inequality is perpetuated by urban policy discourse through the erection of tecno-political barriers of knowing and imagining between the poor and the rich.
313,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,The informal and the formal.
314,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,The just city and the unjust.
315,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,"It is through language and discourse that the city is governed and imagined, with policy shedding light into how formal institutions respond (or don’t)."
316,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,"Places should be RE-ARTICULATED by local need and given new meaning by those who use them, moving planning away from a top down imposition to the COLLABORATIVE development of knowledge and policy."
317,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,10. Plan-Tech:
318,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,Technology and digitalisation provide a great opportunity to move away from PDF planning towards a more just and transparent method of urban governance.
319,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,"However, it must be remembered that this is a process not an end result in itself so ‘plan-tech’ should be utilized in careful, sustainable and collaborative ways."
320,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,Technology such as “commonplace” and “VU city” must be used by urban professionals to improve understanding of the built environment and explain spatial inequalities simply.
321,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,"Additionally, technology can be used to improve the process of ENGAGEMENT with options ranging from online examinations and inquiries to SIMPLIFYING the number of steps to comment online."
322,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,Our 10 themes provide a blueprint for how we can rearticulate and reimagine the urban environment.
323,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,"In the face of a global pandemic, climate crisis and rising inequality, now more than ever, humanity must create a more equitable urban landscape and fair society for all."
324,7,UK,10 points for equity and equality in the built environment,"A just city is possible, now is the time to act."

390,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,What rights do the people of the City deserve?
391,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,This is something that should be asked by cities and governments all around the world.
392,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"If discussed fully, this question would show the inequalities that are present everywhere."
393,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"There are many groups of people that have a disproportionate number of inequalities against them, one group being Refugees of a young age."
394,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,Can you imagine the negative impact the Refugee crisis has on this young generation?
395,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,These children have seen their families killed and have had their childhood ripped away from them.
396,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,Did you know that “over half of the world’s Refugees are children”? (UNHCR)
397,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"Did you know that “only 50% of Refugee children attend primary school” (UNHCR, 2016), compared to “a global average of more than 90%”? (UNESCO, 2017)"
398,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"Did you know that “only 22 % of Refugee adolescents attend secondary school” (UNHCR, 2016), compared to “a global average of 84%” (UNESCO, 2017)?"
399,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,Did you know that “more than 6.6 million Refugees live in camps” (UNHCR)?
400,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"Did you know that the “top three causes of death in Refugee children under five are neonatal deaths (31%), malaria (8.3%) and lower respiratory tract infections (5.6%)”? (UNHCR)"
401,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,Do you know that this young generation is our future?
402,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,So why make their path towards this future so dark?
403,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"The answer to all these questions should be: all people, especially children, deserve a bright future; they deserve Equality."
404,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,But what does Equality mean to a young Refugee?
405,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"Equality means that every person is entitled to certain basic necessities, with the minimum being: Housing, Healthcare and Education."
406,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"Typically, young Refugees do not have access to any of these things."
407,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"After being forced to flee the home of their birth, they are treated as second-class people."
408,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,They are not allowed access to necessary Education.
409,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,They are shunned by Healthcare professionals.
410,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,They are forced to live in camps and tents while someone else decides their future.
411,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,What does Equality mean to a young Refugee?
412,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"If we think about the term “Refugees” in regards to Equality, then we should not refer to them in that way."
413,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"A better term is “Haven Seekers,” as they are people seeking a safe and peaceful life away, from danger and wars."
414,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"To reach Equality, we need to start with Integration."
415,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,A necessity for Integration is an adequate Standard of Living.
416,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"And the easiest way to achieve this, is with proper Housing."
417,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"Haven Seekers cannot be placed in areas that are undesirable, like they regularly are."
418,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"Their Housing must be in suitable neighborhoods, right next to those of the native-born people. For young Haven Seekers to succeed, they must have access to all of the same goods and services."
419,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,This promotes their Integration; showing them they are on equal footing with the rest of the City.
420,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"If put in this position, Haven Seekers can begin adding Value to the City in their own unique way."
421,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,This Integration can be implemented by the City’s government.
422,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"With mixed income Housing that is accessible to all goods and services, as a base, and a certain percentage of each neighborhood reserved for Haven Seekers."
423,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,Healthcare is the Integration system that is the most convoluted.
424,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"Because of the precarious legal status of Haven Seekers, neither they nor Healthcare workers are sure what level of care they are entitled to."
425,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"Their health records are often unclear because of a lack of medical history (Chiarenza, A., 2019). Young Haven Seekers are particularly vulnerable because they do not know their history and there is a language barrier for both them and their parents (Chiarenza, A., 2019)."
426,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"Additionally, they have trauma-related needs and often deal with longer administrative processes (Chiarenza, A., 2019)."
427,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"For a young Haven Seeker to truly Integrate, Healthcare is not an issue they should have to worry about."
428,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,This is possible with governmental aid from the City.
429,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"Specifically, by having a Healthcare system that does not charge Haven Seekers, and having dedicated personnel that specialize in their health issues."
430,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"Then, Haven Seekers will be able to focus on their Integration to the City, so they can add their Value."
431,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"For young Haven Seekers, Education is the most important aspect of Integration."
432,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,School is where these children develop most of their social skills and really begin to feel like a part of the City.
433,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"Unfortunately, this is also one of the areas where they are most disproportionately affected."
434,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"The legal and administrative processes they go through often restricts them from entering school for long periods, even though they are already lacking Education from their time migrating (Koehler & Schneider, 2019)."
435,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,This does not even account for the language barriers and psychological trauma that Haven Seekers have to overcome.
436,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"Education should be the system that “fosters social inclusion, economic growth and innovation” among young Haven Seekers (Koehler & Schneider, 2019)."
437,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,Education is the best system for allowing Haven Seekers to add Value to the City.
438,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"Therefore, the government should ensure that they are Integrated into the Educational system with the same consideration as native-born students."
439,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"This can be done by getting the young Haven Seekers into the system as quickly as possible, with a personalized curriculum to account for the additional support that they need."
440,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"Additionally, there are nonprofit organizations that play a large role in helping Haven Seekers Integrate to the City."
441,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"These organizations have programs that support them with money, medical assistance, access to language classes, as well as vocational and employment assistance."
442,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,These programs help them to feel like they are on equal ground in the City.
443,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"These are often ethnic, religious or charity organizations."
444,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"Their only goal is to help Haven Seekers overcome the difficulties they face in this new land.  They are treated as a human no matter where they came from, their religion, group, gender, age, or sexual orientation."
445,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"No person should be persecuted because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, affiliation to a group, or otherwise."
446,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,Those Haven Seekers are always welcome to our City.
447,9,USA,The right to a safe haven,"Here, they will find a place that prioritizes Integration, which leads to Value for the people and the City."

509,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"Cities are reflections of societies, as such, the COVID-19 pandemic has proven the vulnerabilities of our ways of living."
510,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"A collection of manifestos invites people to participate in sharing alternative ideas, with a focus on the Just City."
511,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"The Just City is considered to be a utopia, however, this manifesto postulates ten fundamental conditions that will act as leverage on the transition from the current model of a city towards “The Just City”."
512,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,1. Time: The Just City is a humanistic city that allocates time.
513,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,The imposed social-distancing measures and teleworking have made us realign our daily routine.
514,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"The pandemic has raised consciousness for the way that the time is being spent, but it is not something we can just distribute to our likening."
515,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"By giving a different value to time, we reconsider the importance of work, which becomes an activity rather than a daily objective."
516,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"In the Just City, every inhabitant should be able to distribute their time in an equal manner."
517,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,2. Isotropy: The Just City is a polycentric city.
518,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,The crisis has highlighted this failed relationship between the city center and its urban context.
519,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"The basic services provided to citizens are numerous, yet they are not distributed equally."
520,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"Through the concentration of basic services, accessing them becomes a time-consuming effort and therefore a social divider."
521,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"Thus, the Just City must provide a spatial balance for every citizen to reach their essential facilities with a similar effort."
522,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,3. Mobility: The Just City is an accessible city.
523,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"A significant impact, but also one of the main reasons for the virus spreading is in regard to our freedom of movement."
524,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"The pandemic has made us aware of the limit of convenient and fast ways of commuting, whether it is short distances or on a global scale."
525,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"In multiple locations, the governments had to limit the journeys to the few very essential ones."
526,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"Following the idea of hyper-proximity, each citizen should be able to do their essential daily activities by walking or at maximum biking distance."
527,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"Thus, the Just City must provide sustainable and green mobility routes."
528,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,4. Equity: The Just City is an inclusive city.
529,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"During the pandemic, cities exemplified the ultimate disparity between well-off and impoverished people."
530,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"Many people could rely on private equity of any kind, such as a garden, health-insurance, or a laptop."
531,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"Additionally, the more vulnerable people became the more severely affected victims of the virus, socially, financially, psychologically, spatially, and physically."
532,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"Thus, the Just City guarantees well-balanced policies that grant each inhabitant fair access to basic infrastructures and support in their essential needs."
533,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,5. Urbanity: The Just City is a shared and lively environment.
534,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,The restrictions on public life and the private sector in the wake of the pandemic made tangible the importance of diverse public spaces.
535,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"They have been spaces of compensation for leisure, walking, working out, etc."
536,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"However, not everyone had equal access to qualitative public space close to home."
537,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"On the contrary, we tend to ascribe monopolized uses to our public space available, such as infrastructure or car parking."
538,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"Therefore, the Just City provides a diversity, quality, and quantity of public spaces available and accessible."
539,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,6. Health: The Just City stimulates people to be physically active.
540,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"The pandemic has highlighted that for many people, daily journeys were the only physical activity."
541,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,The health crisis has raised people’s general awareness in the lack of physical activity.
542,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,Encouraging recreational activities will result in a healthier society.
543,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"Thus, the Just city must provide diverse spaces for people to be active."
544,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,7. Production: The Just City is a place of local production.
545,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"The pandemic has proven the fragility of consumerist societies that depend on globalized economies, and just-in-time productions."
546,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"On the contrary, local productions were less affected by global disruptions."
547,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"The objective is that economies become self-sustaining, regional, circular, and sustainable."
548,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"Therefore, the Just City must adopt a flexible and resilient economy."
549,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,8. Sustainability: The Just City is a conscious and ecological city.
550,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,The pandemic has forced us to reflect on our consumption choices and our habits.
551,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"When the everyday urban life came to a stand-still, the people found refuge in nature."
552,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"A new consciousness has emerged, which refers to our way of living having crucial effects on the environment."
553,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"Thus, the Just City must reconsider nature as a crucial part of the urban environment."
554,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,9. Education: The Just City is an informative and engaging city.
555,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"he pandemic has shown us that the lack of communication led to a misunderstanding of the situation. Through education, we share the morals, values, and norms of society."
556,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"As such, learning is not solely bound to institutional education, but takes place through daily interactions."
557,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,Creating platforms to inform citizens will have a positive impact on public awareness.
558,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"Therefore, the Just City invites people to co-create the city through open discussions."
559,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,10. Contextuality: The Just City is a contextual city.
560,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"In the wake of the pandemic, the city was a reflection of common sanitary, economic, political and social issues."
561,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"Although the concept of the Just City is generic, the city remains a matter of facts and realities."
562,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"In fact, the city is bound to its own urban fabric, culture, politics, topographical settings, etc."
563,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"The very moment we aim to implement the idea of the Just City, we enter at a state of negotiation and debate."
564,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"Finally, The Just City must consider the existing realities."
565,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,This manifesto is part of a continuous process and a collective call to action.
566,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"The above-mentioned conditions offer a set of ideas that contribute to establish justice and rights at an individual, as well as on a collective level."
567,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"As we continue to critically reflect on our environment, further investigating these conditions will draw us closer to the Just City."
568,11,Belgium,POST PANDEMIC,"Thus, opening our way to the future requires us to continuously question the existing reality."
569,12,Netherlands,Bursting the spatial and socio-economic bubbles in cities,"Throughout the years, architects and urban planners have had the power to decide how citizens behave and where they congregate."
570,12,Netherlands,Bursting the spatial and socio-economic bubbles in cities,The historical decisions of past urban planners have influenced how we live today.
571,12,Netherlands,Bursting the spatial and socio-economic bubbles in cities,"In Cape Town, for example, spatial planning was used to separate different races which have led to the current segregation within the city’s spatial fabric."
572,12,Netherlands,Bursting the spatial and socio-economic bubbles in cities,"This phenomenon is seen internationally and has disrupted the possibilities of social cohesion thus, initiating the alienation of social groups within cities."

591,12,Netherlands,Bursting the spatial and socio-economic bubbles in cities,There is a lot of urban planning which is being done based off of the amount of income the project can produce.
592,12,Netherlands,Bursting the spatial and socio-economic bubbles in cities,Social benefits should be considered as profits alongside or above monetary profits.
593,12,Netherlands,Bursting the spatial and socio-economic bubbles in cities,"As highlighted in ‘Planning for people, not profit’, there are a lot of people rising up and speaking against planning for profit (Brenner, Marcuse, & Mayer, 2010)."

595,12,Netherlands,Bursting the spatial and socio-economic bubbles in cities,We aim to change the minds of city developers by suggesting a participatory game.
596,12,Netherlands,Bursting the spatial and socio-economic bubbles in cities,The goal of this game is to illustrate that the players win when they focus less on monetary profits but more on the social benefits.
597,12,Netherlands,Bursting the spatial and socio-economic bubbles in cities,This game is based on the Corporate Growth Game concept that is still being developed.
598,12,Netherlands,Bursting the spatial and socio-economic bubbles in cities,"It focuses on the soft factors of ethics and emotional thinking, rather than the hard factor of rational thinking (Apeldoorn, Sabil, Personal communication, December 15, 2020)."

624,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet",Our priorities
625,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet",Today the cities are the places where most of the people live and where the majority of inequalities coexist and take shape.
626,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet","How can we ad-just the cities, while balancing the planet’s socio-economic and environmental polarization?"
627,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet",We would like to reflect on four dichotomies that we want to prioritize for future research and action.
628,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet",Balancing Physical and Digital Space
629,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet","Our planning practices should include and be based on both material and immaterial realities, meaning the physical and biological sphere of life together with the parallel digital world."
630,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet","The question of how digital infrastructures influence the connections between places should interest planners as railways, highways and other infrastructures that influence the life at the spatial level; the analysis of the impacts of the digital revolution over cities can be a guideline for better planning opportunities, as we see with the smart cities plans happening all over the world."
631,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet","At the same time, the integration of technology in planning theory and practice can highlight the position that citizens and decision makers want to place in the discourse about the balance between tangible urban life and living in an intangible digital space."
632,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet","The dematerialization of urban life of which big global cities are witness, due to overuse of technology must be at the centre of future reflections on cities and regions in order to enhance the distribution of powers and opportunities instead of centralizing them."
633,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet",Balancing Local and Global Economies
634,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet",Local economies and cultures should not “suffer” under the overpowering effects of globalization. Globalization has arguably caused a polarization of cities within the global financial and economic network and a polarization within cities between local and global systems and structures.
635,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet",According to Sassen (2001) a global city elite has emerged that concentrates command and control functions on a global scale.
636,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet",Within the city the increased wealth accommodated by globalised organisations and its demand for low skilled labour has proven to have a segregative social impact that can be a cause of urban poverty.
637,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet","Being crucial nodes of global systems has also influenced the urban design and structure of urban centres, such as gentrifications and other dynamics across the globe, causing a rift between local and global structures within the urban landscape, economies and social groups."
638,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet",For this reason city governance should aim to protect and encourage local infrastructures and economies for the well-being of the communities and neighbourhoods across the city.
639,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet",Balancing the Dynamics between the Global North and South
640,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet","The division of ‘North’ and 'South', used to refer to social, political and economic differences between developed and developing countries has influenced the ways of development cooperation (such as financial aid) as a one-way mechanism."
641,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet","However, it is becoming more and more apparent that there needs to exist a two-way approach of solving problems in this great North-South divide."
642,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet","While the global North has traditionally been seen as knowledge intensive and the global South as resource intensive, there needs to be a recognition of the role the global South can play as a knowledge base and vice versa."
643,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet","While the global North is technologically advanced, the global South can teach a lot about flexibility and adaptability."
644,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet","The complex network of informal enterprises in the global south, for example, are supposed to be highly unorganised but in reality are highly organised and strongly controlled."
645,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet",The recent example of the Coronavirus pandemic exposed the increasingly apparent idea that we are more dependent on each other than we thought.
646,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet","A more equal and balanced North-South cooperation and recognising values, experiences and knowledge in each other is the answer to a better world."
647,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet",Balancing the Urban and Rural Transformations
648,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet","In 2020, the urban transition is in full swing, while the disparities at the social and economic level are rising between the urban and the rural areas."
649,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet","Moreover, transitional zones, with uncertain characteristics and spatial meaning are growing under the spectrum of a development based on exploitation of resources and inequalities."
650,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet","Cities cannot be sustainable until they do not find a balance with their neighboring rural and natural areas, about mutual respect of their own metabolisms of production and consumption."
651,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet","The priority for a just city is to manage respectfully its dependency to the rural areas, in particular for the production of food and for the preservation of the natural environment. For this reason, city-centric plans cannot be the answer for a more even development without the full-fledged involvement of rural communities in the process."
652,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet",Call for (refl)Action
653,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet",Urban practitioners must prioritise flexibility and adaptability to achieve a more balanced world with a redistributive and regenerative approach.
654,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet",Participatory and inclusive vision-making will help to identify a more comprehensive vision for the long-term that will aid better decision making for the short-term.
655,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet",Narrowing the divide between academia and practice is a necessary first step to ensure building this flexible approach.
656,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet","As a way to preserve the priorities mentioned above, we as urban planning students and young practitioners, can connect in an international network to promote field experiences, to understand ground realities and reflect upon current urban issues."
657,13," Denmark, Germany, Italy","Ad-Just the City, Re-Balance the Planet",This can help cultivate mindsets that can enable planning to respond to the challenges of this century while providing equal distribution of resources and opportunities.

805,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,Manifesto for city
806,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,Our cities are changing daily or even hourly.
807,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,"As a result, the urban future of cities cannot be programmed on a very detailed scale. Nevertheless, we can try to predict some options and attract attention to particular areas. Defining a structure and also posing some questions in different areas could facilitate planning for the cities."
808,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,This approach will also prepare a situation for interdisciplinary cooperation amongst professionals.
809,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,The offered structure will be like a categorized shelf with some empty spaces.
810,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,"Those empty spaces will hopefully trigger designers, urban planners and also sociologists all over the world to step in and contribute to the movement."
811,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,"As mentioned before the structure as a vital part of any system gives us strategic and critical information, which can optimize the process of decision making."
812,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,"Since clarity allows the users to know every aspect, it is an essential feature in a dynamic structure which can evolve much easier and faster."
813,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,The other point in this kind of systemizing urban planning is the quantification for the quality of social and physical life of the city.
814,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,"The main idea that we want to suggest in this manifesto is that city as a phenomenon which plays a constitutional role in our lives, should be seen as a clear-dynamic structure."
815,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,The purpose of giving a manifesto is probably to try to get closer to our ideal city.
816,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,Therefore many people during all these years have tried to ascertain this need by defining utopias.
817,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,"Initially, we want to discuss Utopia and heterotopia separately and also in the context of urban planning systems."
818,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,“Utopias are sites with no real place.
819,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,They are sites that have a general relation of direct or inverted analogy with the real space of Society.
820,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,"They present Society itself in a perfected form, or else Society turned upside down, but in any case, these utopias are fundamentally unreal spaces.”"
821,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,This is the definition of Utopia presented by Michel Foucault in his article “Of other spaces”.
822,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,"By considering aspects of Utopia, it comes to mind that presenting another one cannot be the solution of our era."
823,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,"In opposition to Utopia, there is the concept of heterotopia."
824,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,"“As for the heterotopias as such, how can they be described?"
825,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,What meaning do they have?
826,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,"We might imagine a sort of systematic description that would, in a given society, take as its object the study, analysis, description, and ‘reading’ of these different spaces, of these other places."
827,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,"As a sort of simultaneously mythic and real contestation of the space in which we live, this description could be called heterotopology.”"
828,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,The definition of Michel Foucault gives us some useful hints about how our thinking of the cities should be.
829,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,"Heterotopic spaces take place beyond the borders of our daily life; therefore, they can lead to meaningful layers."
830,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,They have the nullification power towards existing disciplines.
831,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,Heterotopia is a state of disorder and interruption in space and time.
832,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,It has a dynamic spirit which suits perfectly with what we expect from our cities to function in the best way possible.
833,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,"In other words, our goal is planning for the city as a consistent, vivid object."
834,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,"The other concept, which is very useful and may change the way we think about urban planning, is juxtaposition."
835,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,"As Foucault mentions it: “We are in the epoch of simultaneity: we are in the epoch of juxtaposition, the epoch of the near and far, of the side-by-side, of the dispersed.”"
836,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,It seems to be the most excellent manifest among heterotopias.
837,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,Juxtaposition contains every aspect of the multiplied characteristics of the city and Society.
838,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,This idea versus blending will lead to acceptance and empowering minorities.
839,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,This process works by gathering different things and stop trying to make a mixture of them. Keeping all individual identities next to each other seems to be a constructive way of diversity appreciation in the cities.
840,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,Therefore It seems mandatory for our age to think of the city mechanism as a juxtaposition.
841,17,Iran,City as a juxtaposition,"In the end, we want to add that this manifesto is not aiming to solve or maybe consider the solution, but to question the system of Utopia, the way we see and live in our cities."

898,19,India,Manifesto for a Just City,The onset of injustices in India can be traced back to the arrival of the caste system.
899,19,India,Manifesto for a Just City,It is a traditional system of rigid social stratification that segregates Hindus based on circumstances of birth and occupation.
900,19,India,Manifesto for a Just City,"People are locked into the occupation of their forefathers at the time of birth, thereby normalizing the cruelty and inhuman treatment of those at the bottom rungs."

909,19,India,Manifesto for a Just City,The arguments for growth are that its benefits will trickle down.
910,19,India,Manifesto for a Just City,"However, it is seen that in most developing and developed countries, the number of inequalities and homelessness increases with an increase in wealth (Farha L., 2020)."

1402,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,"The nowadays city faces a challenge: inserting itself in a transnational financial circuit while, given the dimension of democracy, fulfilling its duty to represent its residents in the configuration of the urban space."
1403,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,"The just city needs to recognize the oppressions and disparities structured by capital and provide democratic spaces where groups are able to dialogue on an equal basis and decide for the collectivity, putting discussions and divergences in check."
1404,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,"This city should not deny or minimize the disagreements and the conflicts, but recognize the interests of all without provoking erasures."
1405,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,"As urban planners, key professionals in the construction of the city's space, we have in our hands the task of contributing to the transformation for a more collective city, one that builds solidarities in diversity and that faces conflicts as a driving force for thinking alternative and innovative solutions in face of oppressions."
1406,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,A city without conflict presumes a city where everyone thinks the same.

1412,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,Active Participation.
1413,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,Broad popular participation in the decision making spaces is necessary for structural changes to be made through public policies.
1414,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,The role of the planner as an agent capable of dialoguing and finding possible paths in this process of constructing social justice is also fundamental.

1418,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,Planners as mediators in the negotiation of urban conflicts!
1419,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,"Starting from this plural city, full of conflicts and different visions, the planner has a role and a duty - which is, by the way, political -  of mediation in the democratic field, so that the collective interest prevails in urban disputes."
1420,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,"In cases where institutional decision-making spaces do not open up for this type of action, for popular participation or for public debate, it is necessary to look for loopholes, and new spaces for action, together with excluded urban groups, working through insurgent planning, looking for new ways for everyone's voices to be heard."
1421,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,Use planning as a transformation tool!
1422,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,Urban planning has the capacity of transforming the city’s space.
1423,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,Investing in a more inclusive type of planning is a duty of a democratic public administration.
1424,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,"Planning does not always serve this purpose, especially when it is related to neoliberal interests, large economic groups and the private sector in general. Thus, to reach a just city, we argue that the planning should be thought as a tool of transformation - that is, it must be associated with the search of social-spatial justice, the mitigation of social and spatial inequalities, and the visibility of the interests of marginalized groups."
1425,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,Engage and empower bottom-up actions!
1426,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,Changing the spatial dynamics of contemporary cities meets the idea of realizing the potential of the participation of its multiple residents.
1427,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,"It is only the citizen practice, the daily exercise of citizenship, of rights and duties, that collaborates to guarantee rights, social achievements, structural change and the decolonization of territories."
1428,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,"Planners must ensure active participation and encourage popular power and citizen autonomy, recognizing in the knowledge of the residents potential for alternative planning."

1431,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,Including the Universal Human Rights as a basement and strategie during the planning processes and territorial dispute is important because it creates an international legal and argumentative base.

1434,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,"The access to this right does not come down to a ceiling and four walls, and should include a series of dimensions that integrate an adequate and dignified life standard."
1435,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,"Urban planning must consider the right to housing as key for the guarantee of a more just city, proposing programs and plans focused on habitation that disarm the hegemonic logic of housing as a merchandise and respect the diversity of ways of living."
1436,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,source: authorial collage produced by the authors. 2020.
1437,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,Planning that enables access to urban land!
1438,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,"Urban planning must be designed so that it provides more democratic access to land, allocates spaces for social interest housing, demarcates vulnerable territories as priorities for urbanization, recognizes the importance of the social function of property and legitimizes occupations in obsolete properties."
1439,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,Creating a Legal Framework
1440,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,Create a legal apparatus capable of ensuring the claims made here and a governmental plan that includes the citizens in the construction of the city through participatory projects.
1441,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,A legal framework that institutionalizes the access to the right to housing and the right to the city must be implemented to regulate the exploratory advances of the market.
1442,29,Brazil,PLANNING FOR JUSTICE.,"À robust body of laws, however, is not enough if it is not regulated. Thus, it is also our responsibility, not only as planners, but also as citizens, to claim this effectiveness."
1443,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation
1444,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"For more than 10 years, almost half of the world's population has lived in urban areas, i.e. 55% today against 68% estimated in 2050 according to UN studies (New York, May 2016), which requires more strategic and rational planning of the cities of the future."
1445,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,Urbanization simultaneously involves several challenges to be met in order to maintain an environment and living conditions acceptable to all.
1446,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"The problem of cities therefore undeniably constitutes a great societal, geopolitical and environmental challenge in all the countries of the world, each according to its specific realities."
1447,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"By wishing to see the world become urban, it is the urban rather that becomes the world."
1448,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"From a sociological point of view, the city constitutes a total and encompassing social fact, that is to say a spatio-temporal framework in which all the social interactions that directly or indirectly govern its functioning and its evolution over time take place."
1449,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"The city is, among other things, the focal point and the crossroads of all the natural, material, cultural and symbolic wealth and resources acquired by people."
1450,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"Marked by the rise of New Information and Communication Technologies (NICT), the city is intensifying its production of wealth both in terms of information control and the reduction of spatial distances that they allow to long term."
1451,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"With regard to the phenomenon of modernization / globalization, the architectural exploitation of urban spaces and, by extension their shrinkage (due to the pressure of economic activities), urban sprawl, the evolution of mobility, the continual improvement of modes of living in an urban environment, the ecological imperative which implies an intelligent improvement of the habitat, demand more and more that we rethink the urban in its entirety."
1452,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"All these factors justify the need to either move the city's borders, or to reconstitute them or strengthen them in view of the demands which are suddenly imposed on a new vision and approach to contemporary urban planning."
1453,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"But one thing is certain and verifiable, and that is that urban planning today should take into account the environmental aspect which has been destroyed by the weight of urbanization, in space and in time."
1454,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"According to the approaches of the urban thinkers of yesteryear, the city comes down only to the continuous occupation of space without taking into account the lung of life that nature constitutes for us."
1455,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,So much discussion has been fuelled over the past decades over what has come to be known today as the city or the metropolis.
1456,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"Cities like Yaoundé or Douala in Cameroon are more and more confronted with new challenges (which are added to old challenges), such as the improvement and management of living environments, lifestyles, management of urban mobility, the thorny problem of employment, and the integration of culture as an important lever of socioeconomic development."
1457,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"In addition to this plethora of challenges to be met, there is the ecological challenge which is proving to be the most important even to be met on a worldwide scale."
1458,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"For the ecological challenge is the biggest one, and cities should adapt to this change."
1459,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"Faced with all these challenges which challenge simultaneously town planners, architects, civil engineers, sociologists, environmentalists, psychologists and the entire world community, there is a need to review the foundations, values, the objectives, concepts, management, regulation and governance tools of contemporary urban planning to better understand and restructure the management of urbanization according to the realities of each territory / country."
1460,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,It is also the moment to widen access to reflection to involve all citizens in order to propose a sustainable and inclusive management of long-term urbanization and satisfactory development methods for all.
1461,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,From this comes these specific concerns:
1462,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"How to establish a close link between quality, coherent and legible urban space?"
1463,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,How to work on the ecological modernization of urban spaces without compromising the fairness of uses?
1464,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,Are we able to successfully adapt cities to climate change?
1465,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"In what ways can contemporary urban planning produce an urban offer (housing, transport, services, equipment, common spaces, atmospheres, etc.) that is both ecological and attentive to the demands of ever-increasing urbanization?"
1466,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,The world we want to see tomorrow is a world that is concerned about and respectful of nature.
1467,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,We want to see a world reconciled with nature in all its depth to restore the balances that have been broken for a long time.
1468,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"We want to see a world less greedy in terms of space because the financial resources remain the sinews of war, therefore not easily accessible to all."
1469,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,This is the reason why we advocate for the economy of the soil by emphasizing our proposals within the framework of the city in height (the compact city).
1470,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"As the environment is the lifeblood of ecosystems, it makes sense for us to convince all citizens to reduce the misuse of natural resources, the destruction of flora and fauna and reduce the use of chemical fertilizers."
1471,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"Because all these excesses have impacted the living environment in which we live, our health and subjected us to a phenomenon that may be irreversible, which is the greenhouse effect responsible in large part for current climate change."
1472,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"We are therefore obliged to carefully plan a sustainable ecological transition that will fight for the preservation of the remaining natural resources, the replenishment of plundered resources and the maintenance of social, economic and cultural development. Because it is the future of our planet."
1473,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,We offer and recommend simultaneously
1474,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"First and foremost, the reframing and reorientation of the teaching of urban trades towards the concrete (no longer theoretical) protection of the environment in our establishments and universities."
1475,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"Second, the harmonization of urbanization with the economy of land to limit urban sprawl, a source of global warming."
1476,30,France,For a Modern and Sustainable Urbanisation,"Lastly, the deep reconstitution of the earth's lungs of life, like destroyed forests, fields and more."

1579,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME",or the accessibility for an adequate life and sanitation?
1580,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME","This should be answered by profoundly looking at specific and unique needs of people in cities, especially the vulnerable one."

1592,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME",These statements push cities to provide the minimum needs to these vulnerable people by implementing some policies.
1593,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME","For example, millions of homeless are denied,  from the right to work because governments are worried about their potential to displace locals from jobs."
1594,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME","But this is actually not the main reason:  the state of the nationality, where the person has not any status,  it is impossible and so complicated to live and to find dwellings to live …this means they have not an address where they to live!"

1606,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME",That gives us a broader view of different solutions and we desire to be part of a solution.
1607,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME",We understand that housing is not a right but at least there would be easier ways to get one. Everyone deserves to be in their own shelters.
1608,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME","We as planners claim for the city justice and fight for inclusiveness, when thinking about the city."
1609,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME",Our vision is to implement tools that everyone can have access to.

1618,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME","The first one is changing our mindset, stop looking at homeless people with indifference and see them as part of society."
1619,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME","The second action applies to a group of several decisions which should be taken with the authorities and direct a specific budget to the implementation of projects for homeless people. As we mention, housing is a shelter, so we propose to give at least a place to people to feel safe and not leave them in the streets."
1620,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME","On the other hand, crowded places aren’t a solution, as human beings they deserve respect and the respect of their space."
1621,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME",A good solution already implemented in several cities is the remodeling of old or disused infrastructure so that it can be used again.
1622,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME",It is known that several states or municipalities invest in urban furniture design for preventing homeless people from sleep in public areas.
1623,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME",So why not invest in proper places for them?
1624,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME",Many Instruments must be  implemented in order to protect the homeless.
1625,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME","By Safeguarding their physical integrity and protecting their rights, and  fulfilling them. Respecting their right contributes to facilitating the self-help."
1626,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME","Those people though, should be protected by a law."
1627,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME",The governments should ensure and protect their rights in society because they are vulnerable.
1628,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME","Finally , when respecting and protecting , rights became fulfilled to adequate housing."
1629,33,France,"SWEET, SWEET HOME",Could we imagine a future city where no one has to sleep in the streets anymore ?
