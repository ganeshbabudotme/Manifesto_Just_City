# What is A MANIFESTO FOR THE JUST CITY

For us, the Just City is not only a place that allows all its citizens to live a healthy and accomplished life, but also a city that allows the planet to regenerate itself and fosters civic life and democracy, affording all its citizens the RIGHT TO THE CITY.

In order to collect ideas and discuss ways to teach and learn how to make our cities more just, sustainable and inclusive, we wanted to hear from students from all over the world.

The manifesto was written in groups of  3 to 5 students in any discipline related to the built environment (spatial planning, urban geography, design, architecture, landscape design, engineering, etc.) The manifesto was to be written in in any language, provide that a good English translation is provided by the participants with a word limit of around 1000 words. 

In order to help students write their manifestos, a 4-part Urban Thinkers Campus was organised by TU Delft and partner universities online.

Each part of this activity provided students with new ideas about key topics of urban development, just like a mini-online course. In each session, opportunity to debate with like-minded people from other universities were created. 

We received around 44 manifestos from student groups in different parts of the world.

# Analysing the Manifestos

To compare across the manifestos, I did a sentiment analysis of the content of the manifestos.
The results and inferences are to be published in the conference proceddings.

The CSV file with the text of the manifestos is in this repository if you wish to do the analysis yourself, to derive your own inferences.
The manifesto title and country of university can be used to compare across different manifestos.
